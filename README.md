# Hydrogen

Hydrogen is a *single-function server* library; or in other words, an immutable,
minimalistic HTTP abstraction mapping input requests to output responses. A basic
server using Jetty as the backend can be created in just one line of code.

	Jetty.start(request -> Response.ok().text("Hello, world!"));

Hydrogen is built with type-safety, immutability, and testability in mind.
A server built with Hydrogen can be tested without ever starting an actual
server runtime, because requests and responses are both simple POJOs.

## No Magic
Hydrogen does not contain any static mutable state, runtime code generation,
annotation processing, or any other kind of control-flow altering feature.

## Lightweight
Any heavyweight objects generated by the server runtime are mapped onto lightweight
POJOs before being passed to the handler.

## Disclaimer
Hydrogen is not battle-tested, nor is it ready for production use (yet). Look
out for version 1.0.0, in the meantime, make sure to watch, star, and post
your suggestions in the issue tracker.
